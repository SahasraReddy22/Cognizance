This program will allow the user to find the nth term of a fibonacci number series
Declare the variables currentterm,nextterm,previousterm,nthterm,i as integers
Ask the user to enter which term they want
Input:nthterm
Store the number as nthterm
Initialize the terms: previousterm=0,currentterm=1
For i=1 to nthterm
Assign  nextterm=currentterm+previousterm
	previousterm=currentterm
	currentterm=nextterm
end for loop
Print previousterm
end
